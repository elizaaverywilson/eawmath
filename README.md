EAWMath is my LaTeX styles, classes, and templates for my undergraduate math classes and study. 

I have a class and a template for homework assignments, and Iâ€™m working on one for notes. This project aims to generalize as much of the homework and note formatting as I can, so that new assignments can be created with minimal attention to formatting. I also use a number of macros that aim to allow for LaTeX commands that are closer to the mathematical terminology, rather than an independent LaTeX technology.

This is a personal project, and my primary goal is to use this project for my own studies, but I would be glad to know it helped someone else. As such, my documentation is sparse, and there are some aspects that are specific to me and may not be generalizable to other students. I would welcome pull requests to supply documentation, increase usability for other students, or other improvements.
